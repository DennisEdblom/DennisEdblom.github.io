    description: Collaborative project between Linköping University and Saab Dynamics. The main goal with this project is to create an autonomous rescue system with an UAV and a tracked vehicle. The autonomous rescue system's main goal is to find people in distress, represented by AprilTags, in an assigned test area and provide assistance.

  - title: Bachelors Project - Autonomous Driving
